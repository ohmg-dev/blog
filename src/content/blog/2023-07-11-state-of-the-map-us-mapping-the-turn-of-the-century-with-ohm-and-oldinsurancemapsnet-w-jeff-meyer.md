In June I went to Richmond, Va. to present with Jeff Meyer from [OpenHistoricalMap](https://openhistoricalmap.org) at the State of the Map US, an annual meeting for the OpenStreetMap US organization. It was a fantastic conference, and our presentation "**Mapping the turn of the Century with OHM and OldInsuranceMaps.net"** was really well-received. We demonstrated how people can georeference maps in OIM and then turn around and use them as basemap layers in OHM to digitize historical buildings and other features. The next day we did a workshop as well, where people used this workflow with Sanborn maps of Richmond.
