After a couple years of researching, programming, and then a lot of writing, I've completed my final MS thesis document: ["Creating a Public Space for Georeferencing Sanborn Maps: A Louisiana Case Study".](https://repository.lsu.edu/gradschool_theses/5641/)

Many thanks is owed to my committee for working with me through the project, and especially all of the participants in the crowdsourcing pilot project last spring!
