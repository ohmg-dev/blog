Last month I gave a talk about [OldInsuranceMaps.net](http://OldInsuranceMaps.net) for I-GUIDE's Virtual Consulting Office speaker series, and a recording is now available to watch here: [https://i-guide.io/i-guide-vco/a-look-inside-oldinsurancemaps/.](https://i-guide.io/i-guide-vco/a-look-inside-oldinsurancemaps/)

I was able to talk more about the technical details of the platform than in the past, in particular the way that the the georeferencing process relies on GDAL's "virtual raster" file format, and how this is used for the live preview feature of the georeferencing interface.
