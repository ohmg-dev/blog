By December 2020 I had decided to build my georeferencing platform as an extension on top of GeoNode, a open source geospatial content management system. I was able to present my ideas about how and why this would work to the GeoNode community at the [GeoNode Virtual Summit](https://summit.geonode.org/schedule/#session-110).

No recordings made for this talk, but here's a link to the slides: [Extending Geonode to Support Historical Map Georeferencing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSwbTO3jKrwGFKwouZdPSWfQVB3sws8I7bdH_CiSoNTt3l3wefu3s50NAxXn4N7M9CkW09hf9xZh63j/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
