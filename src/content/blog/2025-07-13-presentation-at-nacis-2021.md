In October 2021 I attended my first (in-person) meeting of the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS), held that year in Oklahoma City. My presentation was titled [Creating a Public Space for Georeferencing Sanborn Maps](https://nacis2021.sched.com/event/lXOu/cartographic-resources).

**Abstract:**

> This talk will introduce my thesis work on an online map georeferencing platform tailored to the digital Sanborn Maps collection at the Library of Congress. My approach extends the open source geospatial content management system GeoNode to add a georeferencing interface that anyone can use. Building from GeoNode means that any georeferenced map becomes an OGC-compliant web service available for use in other web maps or desktop GIS clients, and pulling from the Library of Congress collection ensures high quality color scans in the public domain. Ultimately, the project seeks to make local Sanborn maps more accessible to citizens and researchers in communities across the US, while producing new open source software along the way.
