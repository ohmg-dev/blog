Last November, Josh Sadvari and Michelle Hooper hosted a Georef-a-thon at The Ohio State University Libraries using [OldInsuranceMaps.net](http://OldInsuranceMaps.net), and wrote this detailed piece about how they prepared for the event, how the platform worked for them, and what kind of engagement their participants got from the experience.

[Piloting a Sanborn Map Georef-a-thon for GIS Day 2023](https://waml.org/waml-information-bulletin/volume-55-number-2/piloting-a-sanborn-map-georef-a-thon/), WAML Information Bulletin, Western Association of Map Libraries. 2024. Josh Sadvari and Michelle Hooper

Some nice quotes from the article, that illustrate how the event was able to expand knowledge and appreciation of historical maps:

> Very few georef-a-thon participants indicated they had previously used or even heard of Sanborn maps when asked this question during the introduction, which reinforces how such an activity can help in creating awareness of the potential uses of this collection.

> The [OldInsuranceMaps.net](http://OldInsuranceMaps.net) platform provides a low barrier entry point for teaching spatial and data literacy concepts through georeferencing and engaging students in the “process” of geospatial data, illustrating a standalone educational value that was perhaps not envisioned as a specific outcome during the platform’s conceptualization and development but could be one nonetheless
