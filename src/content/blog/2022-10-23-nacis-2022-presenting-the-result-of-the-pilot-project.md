In October 2022 I attended NACIS Annual Meeting in Minneapolis and presented the results of the crowdsourced georeferencing pilot project I had carried out earlier that year. My presentation was titled [Crowdsourced Georeferencing Sanborn Maps of Louisiana](https://nacis2022.sched.com/event/pgR6/cartographic-research-i). The title is basically just an arbitrary rearrangement of words I'd used before, but the talk itself contains a lot of detail around how well the site worked for people, and discussion of how and why people participated.

**Abstract:**

> Earlier this year for my masters thesis I designed and facilitated a crowdsourcing effort to georeference historical Sanborn fire insurance maps of 138 towns and cities across Louisiana. The scanned maps were pulled directly from the Library of Congress digital collection into a web-based georeferencing platform, built from GeoNode for this project. Sheets from 276 Sanborn editions were georeferenced, creating over 1,500 spatial layers that were later combined into mosaics and transferred to LSU for long-term public access. In this talk, I will present some of the workflows used and pitfalls encountered, and elaborate on how and why people participated.
