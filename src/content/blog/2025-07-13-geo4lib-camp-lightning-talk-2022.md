At the very beginning of the pilot project period, I was able to do a short remote presentation for the folks at [Geo4Lib Camp 2022](https://geo4libcamp.org/2022/). No slides for this, it was just a live demo of the site which was about to go live for the public to use. It is probably the best demonstration of how the platform looked and worked through that period of time.
