After working with Kiri and Sanjay from Development Seed for about a year, we finally put together this post for Dev Seed's blog: [Open Source Spotlight - Old Insurance Maps.](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2023-12-01-spotlight-oldinsurancemaps/) This came about because Kiri saw my presentation at FOSS4G Southeast in Nashville last year, where I described how I had reworked [OldInsuranceMaps.net](http://OldInsuranceMaps.net) to use [TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/) (open source software that Dev Seed created and maintains) for dynamic raster tiling, replacing GeoServer which had been incorporated into the platform from the beginning.

It was very satisfying to put this piece together, and get to talk more about the tech stack that makes OldInsuranceMaps work.
